## ABOUT
I'm Alexis, a young 23 years old web developer, graduated in computer graphics since June 2014.

After a few years of high school learning xHTML, CSS2 or basics of PHP and SQL, I left my native Brittany to study in Belgium for 4 years.
It is only the second year by joining the DWM working group that I came out of my "full developer" trip to get interested into concepts related to the UI and especially to the UX.

Even if it essentially was a design oriented formation, and even if I still love opening my mind about that, my main passion and the reason for this career choice is the code. It’s a bit « nerd » to say that, but I can’t use something else, describe, « refactor » the word « code ».
To become a developer after a mainly « design focus » formation like this one, I – like in high school – learned a lot by myself, as an autodidact.
That’s how a lot of my student projects could be summarized: 80% of my time spent learning new techniques, new languages, but also testing new « fancy animations » and other « funky hacks » to finally use them in the most useless yet funny way possible.
Because I spent 80% of my working time on useless – and therefore indispensable – things for my student’s projects, the last and most important 20% were often done in the last 24 hours.
Sleepless nights were a sort of challenge for me. A challenge because the remaining work was often substantial but, paradoxically, working under pressure was stimulating me.
Today, I think those sleepless nights were completely worth it to learn to manage my stress in my work as in my everyday life.

It was as much a training as a game to me. Maybe also because I didn’t really care about the school marks. Instead of spending my time trying to comply with the conditions and rules of projects, I was trying to circumvent them, to turn them into a funny/stupid borderline subject.
_« Rules are Meant to be Broken »_
I was thinking that even if these student projects were a "training" for our future work and professional life, they do remain nothing more than student projects.
In conclusion, it was the perfect projects to carry out in the most wacky way possible considering that I have the rest of my career to work on serious projects.


As you may have noticed, all of this is first and foremost a big passion for me. The day I will stop having fun with the code, I will probably have to change my profession.
I love the idea that the Internet is still a new world to discover. Although we already have made awesome progress since the creation of the network, everything remains to be invented, created. We are "Indi" himself, the young Harrison Ford with his whip and his adventurer hat.
To me, we have not chosen our Edison or Tesla of the web yet. One of them will revolutionize everything (in the good way I hope).
